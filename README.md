# pointcloud-fl
This project reproduces Vlassis et al. (2023) for generating realistic 3D sand grains, but with the original DDPM replaced by flow matching. It includes a point cloud autoencoder and a UNet-based generative model reimplemented according to the original paper. Generation is performed in the latent space of the pre-trained autoencoder.
